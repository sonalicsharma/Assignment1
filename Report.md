Google Drive
============
Google Drive is a very useful personal cloud storage from Google which allows users to store, share and collaborate files. 
It is ideal for individual as well as group level course assignments or projects. The Google Drive viewer on the web allows to view many file formats like google docs, text files, MS Office, PDFs etc. Also, files in other format can be handled through third party apps. Owners could make file publicly visible or share privately with multiple users. Documents are automatically saved to Googleâ€™s servers to prevent any data loss. Also previous versions of the documents are maintained which could be rolled back if required. A group of people could collaborate on the same document together which makes it usable for non-programming courses. However it lacks some much needed features for source code management. Since all changes are immediately saved, one could not push stable version of code at will. Lack of explicit commits and syncs means a user could not commit related changes in multiple source files together which makes reviews and fixes difficult. Therefore, we cannot add any comments while committing and the reason of modification becomes unclear to programmers which leads to confusion. A programming course might require multiple persons work on same piece of code over a period of time with periodic review and merging. Since Google Drive does not have branch, fork or checkout features as in GitHub or SVN, it is not very useful for programming projects or courses.

GitHub
======
GitHub is a git based revision control hosting service mainly for software development and code sharing. Using GitHub, we could maintain history of changes in the project repository and go back to previous versions as needed. A remote GitHub repository could be cloned to work locally on it. Commits could be made locally even while offline which could be synced to remote repository later. The remote-local model ensures no data loss in case of machine crash. GitHub is useful not only for individual but also for group level projects because multiple persons could modify the same files in parallel. Changes could be made directly on master or on branches and forks. Since git histories provide us differences between different versions or branches, it lets us review the changes and merge them safely. GitHub also allows safe publishing of source-code with proper privileges making it accessible and secure at the same time. 

Due to above features, GitHub could be used in programming courses to share simple text documents or programming assignments too as users could simply clone to get the course or assignment content. However it might not be equally useful for sharing non-code types of files like word documents or binary files in non-programming courses because binary file diffs are not easily readable. Also, they take huge space in git with frequent commits. Even though MS Word and PDFs are text files, they are not readable unless used by specific readers and contain lots of metadata information.
